# animal crossing database

acdb is something i've wanted to create for a long time. nintendo's animal crossing franchise has been a big part of my life since the original came out for the gamecube in 2002. it was the video game that got me into video games. it also responsible for my digital hoarding compulsion.

there are many resources like this that already exist, and most of them are great. but they all seem to be missing one category of information or another. i seek to remedy this with acdb.

currently, acdb exists as a mess of prefilled react components. it's still being designed. eventually, it will be populated with information from airtable, have express routes, and extensive search and filter functionality.
